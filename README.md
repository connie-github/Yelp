# Project 2 - *Yelp*

Yelp clone app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api) and referencing the [Yelp Style Guide](http://www.yelp.com/styleguide).

Time spent: an appropriate number of hours, reflecting both effort and efficiency

**Required** functionality:

- Search results page
  - [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
  - [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
  - [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
  - [ ] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
  - [ ] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
  - [ ] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
  - [ ] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
  - [ ] Display some of the available Yelp categories (choose any 3-4 that you want).

**Optional** features:

- Search results page
  - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
  - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- Filter page
  - [ ] Implement a custom switch instead of the default UISwitch.
  - [ ] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
  - [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is [here](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list).
  - [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

**Additional** features:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
